        title: 'Lament',
        artist: 'Touche Amore',
        content: `<b>Best album to listen to when everything is falling apart.</b>
        <p>In a year where anxiety repeatedly got the best of me, <em>Lament </em>was my safe haven. From rage-fueled workouts to panic-ridden drives down the interstate, <em>Lament </em>channeled my chaotic thoughts through eleven songs of blistering post-hardcore. Fittingly, singer Jeremy Bolm kicks off the album with a desperate cry for help: &ldquo;From peaks of blue/Come Heroine&rdquo;&mdash;a cleverly drawn double entendre about a woman he relies on to survive tough times&mdash;while the band barrels towards a climax that crashes into the title track. Out of &ldquo;Lament&rdquo; crawls a broken melody that stumbles over itself, wandering aimlessly as Bolm describes a cycle of sadness and anxiety that anyone who has battled with their brains can relate to.</p>
        <p>Each song on <em>Lament </em>peers into a corner of Bolm&rsquo;s personal darkness, yet he allows a few glimpses of light as well, giving the album a determined drive that can bring someone back from the brink of collapse. The first two verses of &ldquo;Limelight'' pour out the depths of Bolm&rsquo;s fatigue with the world, while the third verse takes a last stand as Manchester Orchestra member Andy Hull makes a desperate swim upwards against Bolm's dark chants. He lets his voice reach manic heights as he runs out of breath, fighting for a gasp of air. Self-proclaimed as the catchiest song in their catalogue, &ldquo;Reminders'' combines political disenchantment with the need for self-love, ending on an unanswered question that bellows with personal resonance: &ldquo;Is there a way to feel free/Without being someone else.&rdquo; On &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Your Host,&rdquo; Bolm deals with the aftermath of making music that heals others when he hasn&rsquo;t finished healing himself. Yet even as he wrestles with the weight of countless letters from fans unloading their grief, the song simultaneously serves as a beacon for anyone that has carried the burden of another.</p>
        <p>The lyrics would be enough to make this record great, but the band comes together to elevate <em>Lament </em>to the next level. Each song slams into one another with the two-ton force of thunderous production and never-ending crescendos, a collection of revelation packed anthems that rush relentlessly to brutally catchy refrains. The stadium sized &ldquo;Deflector&rdquo; is home to false peaks, showcasing the group&rsquo;s deft grasp of song structure -- an unexpected break teases a finale that satisfyingly arrives and impossibly one-ups the rest of the song. After catching one of the only breaths allowed on the album, &ldquo;A Broadcast&rdquo; perfectly captures clenched-fist earnestness, rousing a wordless chorus that would be cliche if Bolm&rsquo;s ragged vocal cords accented by pedal steel didn&rsquo;t make it magical.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For all the hooks and lessons in <em>Lament</em>, nothing is more powerful than the final track &ldquo;A Forecast.&rdquo; Against the distant keys of a sparse piano, Bolm takes a moment to quietly review his progress in processing his mother&rsquo;s death (&ldquo;Since the last time we&rsquo;ve met/I&rsquo;ve healed more than suffered&rdquo;), and then everything implodes. Ocean-deep bass thunders as sparks of guitar shower down upon a heartfelt confession: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still out in the rain/I could use/A little shelter/Now and then.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Lament </em>reminds me that when I fuck up, the world doesn&rsquo;t end, even when I want it to. It&rsquo;s not about winning a fight against dark feelings, it&rsquo;s about the simple act of fighting.</p>`,

        <p>This is another album on the list that helped me through the rushed transition from college to living at home. Before I moved back into my childhood bedroom, I was whisked away to the Rockies with my family, providing me a moment to fully absorb what was happening. We spent hours trudging through deep snow, taking turns clearing a path through the woods and up the mountain. <em>Every Bad </em>accompanied me on this trek, lending acidic strings and fiery guitars to the tornado of thoughts whipped up by the chaos of covid. To listen to <em>Every Bad </em>is to sail a shaky boat through a turbulent sea of feelings while singer Dana Margolin tries to unwind her tangled brain by fashioning neurotic phrases into anthems. This daring voyage allows Porridge Radio to map out the fury and exuberance of being human, hoping just to stay afloat.</p>`,

        content: `<b>Best album to get you into meditation.</b>
        <p>The most basic premise of meditation is to sit and be present. The breath is often used as a focal point - if one gets distracted by thoughts or outside stimuli, focus can always be turned back towards this life force. Phil Elverium&rsquo;s <em>Microphones in 2020</em> starts with just the breath. For the first 8 minutes of the song&rsquo;s forty-five minute duration, two chords played on a five dollar acoustic guitar glide and cascade, unperturbed and at peace. Once Phil enters, he beginsan exercise in excavation, examining his life at three different ages: 17, 20, and 23. Life's undercurrent carries him through ruminations on the frivolity of band names, the tangibility of flashbulb memories, and the strange career of making art, but the song always returns to the breath. <em>Microphones in 2020 </em>simultaneously explores the slippery paradox of the present and the ceaseless nature of time, expressed succinctly in the final lines: "If there have to be words, they could just be/now only and there's no end."</p>`,

        <p>When Fiona casually released this masterpiece into the ether, Pitchfork immediately awarded the album with a perfect ten, something it hadn&rsquo;t done in a decade. Publications stumbled over each other to heap praise upon the undeniable power of <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>, while I myself was scouring over every song in an attempt to glean each stroke of genius. It&rsquo;s an impossibly active record that crashes you through the ceiling of Fiona&rsquo;s home turned explosive parade featuring clanging percussion found in schoolyards; it&rsquo;s a rapidfire joyride through the synapses of her brain. After a few months of residing here, I began to feel like I was overstaying my welcome, and had to take a long break from listening to the album. Nevertheless, I come by to visit every now and then, and it&rsquo;s always a pleasure.&nbsp;</p>`,

        content: `<b>Best album to listen to while locking yourself in a sauna and taking too many drugs</b>
        <p>Drew Daniel&rsquo;s latest solo effort effectively captures what it would sound like if Steve Reich had been an avid raver. The opening track features angelic voices hypnotically repeating the record&rsquo;s title amidst chiming bells, imbuing the album with a strangely monastic quality. Fittingly, the two most important moments are found on the tracks &ldquo;Sinning'' and &ldquo;Grace.&rdquo; On the former, piano, clarinet, and saxophone circle one another in minimalist patterns, while booming bass and syncopated handclaps set up a sweaty club atmosphere. On &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; a gentle piano melody meanders through swirling synths, dissipates into a cloud of raucous ambience, and slyly builds into the album&rsquo;s most transcendent moment. The perfect balance of soothing minimalism and adrenaline-pumping dance music, <em>Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? </em>maps out an ideal vision of ecstasy.</p>`,

        <p>Jeff Parker&rsquo;s <em>Suite for Max Brown </em>is cut from the same exploratory cloth as his renowned work with post-rock group Tortoise. Evading sonic expectations, Parker relentlessly tinkers with the jazz template to incorporate spaced-out ambience and trance-like rhythms into a delightful mood board. The methodical mindset of interlocking grooves on "Fusion Swirl" evaporates into atmospheric track &ldquo;After The Rain,&rdquo; which drizzles drowsy guitar over Vangelis-textured keys, perfectly evoking its namesake. After taking its time on a winding path that keeps you guessing, the record rides out on the ten minute closer &ldquo;Max Brown.&rdquo; Perhaps the most traditional track on the album, it&rsquo;s a satisfying send-off that proves Parker can play it straight too.</p>`,

        content: `<b>Most consistently inconsistent album</b>
        <p>Imagine a new thrift store opened up a few blocks from your place. You&rsquo;ve heard from friends it&rsquo;s a bit janky, but you still want to check it out. It&rsquo;s called <em>Notes On a Conditional Form</em>. Upon entering the store, you&rsquo;re immediately greeted by Greta Thurnburg, who delivers a rousing speech about the immediacy of addressing climate change over twinkling piano. <em>That&rsquo;s very inspiring,</em> you think, <em>but what a bizarre introduction. </em>As you shuffle past Greta and make your way down an aisle, you notice something that seems out of place. A cinematic interlude of Disney proportions (&ldquo;The End (Music for Cars)&rdquo;) and a slice of pastiche punk (&ldquo;People&rdquo;) sit side by side, eschewing any organizational logic. You push through more instrumental filler and arrive at a sparkling gem: &ldquo;The Birthday Party.&rdquo; An alt-country ballad ornamented with banjo and pedal-steel, the song exposes the paranoia and disenchantment Matty Healy holds with his own behavior: &ldquo;I depend/On my friends/To stay clean.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The entire album continues in this hit-or-miss fashion, flirting with a jumbled ensemble of pop templates. Some songs make it seem like Matty&rsquo;s trying on styles just for laughs, such as &ldquo;Roadkill,&rdquo; which emulates Pinegrove so closely that I swear the line about a &ldquo;tucked-up erection&rdquo; is throwing shade at them. &ldquo;Me and You Together Song&rdquo;&mdash;a direct injection of jangly dream pop stolen straight from the 90&rsquo;s&mdash;almost looks like the real thing, but is smothered with a sheen of self-aware tackiness. It successfully rides the line between affecting and annoying, but &ldquo;If You&rsquo;re Too Shy (Let Me Know)&rdquo; crosses it. The chugging synths and yearning lyrics of the verses play to the band&rsquo;s strengths, but the chorus hews dangerously close to the melody and mentality of &ldquo;Shut Up and Dance.&rdquo; The fact that I&rsquo;ll still listen to the entire song, even enduring the cheesy saxophone solo, illustrates the overall appeal of <em>Notes</em>. It&rsquo;s sickeningly earnest enough to make you shake your head, but its addictive catchiness will make you smile. This isn't any more apparent than on the satisfying closer &ldquo;Guys," where Matty ditches the dress-up. Stripping down to his pure self, he sings a sweetly unadorned ode to his bandmates: &ldquo;You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo; <em>Notes On a Conditional Form </em>is far from a perfect album, but I guarantee if you take the time to sort through the mess, you&rsquo;ll find something to take home.</p>`,

        <p>On Fountain, Lyra Pramuk is a master shapeshifter. Her voice is stretched, distorted, and multiplied across 7 tracks with vastly different palettes. &ldquo;Tendril&rdquo; is joyous, floating a soaring melody over buoyant hums, while following track &ldquo;Xeno&rdquo; does a 180 as Lyra takes the form of a horde of locusts, swarming around a dark synth that expands until it blocks out the sun. On &ldquo;Cradle&rdquo;, the drone of a cello draws a fog across Lyra&rsquo;s deeply ruminative singing, untils she breaks forth with a wordless rendition of the English hymn &ldquo;O Waly, Waly&rdquo; that transforms the song into a heavenly hymn. &ldquo;Cradle&rdquo; illustrates what each track on Fountain has in common: the ability to transcend, to swirl and layer fragments of the human voice until they become something greater, something beyond the self.</p>`,

        <p>Julianna Barwick&rsquo;s ethereal experiments have always been soothing, but <em>Healing is a Miracle </em>checks Barwick into therapy. After dealing with the aftershock of a divorce and years of grueling tours, she recently moved from New York to Los Angeles and started dating someone new. She&rsquo;s expanded her typically insular method of layering vocal loops by inviting collaborators to share space on the album. Sigur R&oacute;s&rsquo;s J&oacute;nsi contributes a delicate croon on &ldquo;In Light,&rdquo; flickers of Mary Lattimore&rsquo;s harp decorate &ldquo;Oh, Memory,&rdquo; and Nosaj Thing winds pensive harmonies around Barwick&rsquo;s on &ldquo;Nod.&rdquo; Best listened to when you need to catch a breath.</p>`,

        <p>Last summer I became spellbound by Autechre&rsquo;s 1994 landmark album <em>Amber</em>. The record is known for being Autechre&rsquo;s most emotional and melodic work, leading the duo to later dismiss it as &ldquo;cheesy.&rdquo; Yet the album&rsquo;s papery textures and haunting atmosphere quickly won me over, along with the realization that <em>Kid A </em>definitely took influence from songs like &ldquo;Montreal.&rdquo; 26 years after <em>Amber</em>, and Autechre is still on the bleeding edge of electronic experimentation. In some ways, <em>SIGN </em>mimics the approach of <em>Amber</em>: it&rsquo;s less cold-blooded than Autechre&rsquo;s other output, relying instead on capturing fleeting feelings. <em>SIGN </em>functions as a splatter painting, featuring a myriad of metallic synths that leave a mark on the canvas before dissipating. Squint hard enough and you might be able to make out a sketch of a melody, but more than anything else <em>SIGN </em>is about setting the mood.</p>`,

        <p>Eartheater&rsquo;s new album lurks under the surface.

After escaping haunts of metal-infused glitches and computer-mangled voices, the album finds its haven in the centerpiece &ldquo;Volcano.&rdquo; A classically-bent piano pirouettes while a dejected angel laments (&ldquo;I'm still grinding bones to bake my bread/Grinding on a skull to get ahead&rdquo;). The song presents constant sorrow as a comfort, something to count on. As the album&rsquo;s title suggests, <em>Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin </em>shapes pain into something that glistens.

I waited till everyone had fallen asleep and walked down to our dock that overlooked the water, sitting there and listening to <em>Punisher </em>front to back while watching the river&rsquo;s reflection of the moon.

The minimally undulating piano of &ldquo;Summer All Over'' are reminiscent of Mills&rsquo; work with Perfume Genius, and the patchwork melody handled by guitar, piano, and bass on &ldquo;My Dear One&rdquo; makes the Talk Talk influence clear. Like Mark Hollis, Blake Mills understands that the absence of a sound can be intriguing as the presence of one.&nbsp;</p>`,

        <p>Inspired by the ashes of her relationship with Indigo Sparke, another artist who shares her affinity for open-hearted acoustic folk, <em>songs </em>is Adrianne at her best, a flex of sharp-eyed songwriting set to a menacingly minimal backdrop. Creeping vines of Adrienne&rsquo;s cyclical fingerpicks wind around insights of life swept from small but nonetheless impactful moments that shape her spirit. A dead horse found as a child is the subject of &ldquo;ingydar,&rdquo; spinning into a tale detailing the beauty and horror of mortality: &ldquo;Everything eats and is eaten/ Time is fed.&rdquo; The gorgeously lovesick &ldquo;anything&rdquo; cuts through the humid air of a pedal steel, resting in the open bed of a pickup truck rolling through billowing blades of grass. A prism shaped from shards of memories offers a peek into Adrianne&rsquo;s time with Indigo: a sliced fist from a dog bite, a campfire amongst the pines, and the cradle found in a partner&rsquo;s lap. Adrianne&rsquo;s vulnerable croon devastates and rejuvenates in the same breath, a reminder of the threads that entangle us all together.</p>`,

        <p>A darkened grey was spreading over Tennessee skies as I rushed up the carpeted steps of my family&rsquo;s home, aching to play Adrienne&rsquo;s freshly released <em>instrumentals </em>before dinnertime. The album opens at the creak of a well-worn wooden porch, bending under the dual weight of Adrienne and her guitar. As strums trickled from her fingers like the melt of Spring, and windchimes huddled together in a reverberating embrace, I heard the sky respond with pitter patters of raindrops on my rooftop. I opened my windows to let these two forces of nature meet. In due time melody burst forth from &ldquo;music for indigo&rdquo;,blooming into the flush of watercolored flowers on the album&rsquo;s cover. <em>instrumentals </em>is a wellspring, an invitation to dip into the source of Adrienne&rsquo;s tranquil kinship with Mother Earth, offering a state of pure peace she so effortlessly conjures.</p>`,

        <p>For someone who serves as the prophet of destruction on her band&rsquo;s latest album <em>The Passion Of</em>, Alli Logout is kind and candid. She walks me through her teenage years spent with best friends booking punk shows in an abandoned schoolhouse; unfortunately, outside of her small hometown she was met with an oversaturation of white men in punk who looked down upon her tightly-knit community. Special Interest&rsquo;s second record rings of Alli&rsquo;s upbringing: on it she comes to terms with the dismal state of the world while pulling those close to her even closer, asking them to stand side by side. We talked at a time when Trump&rsquo;s secret forces were snatching people off the streets of Portland, which imbued Alli&rsquo;s work with a saliency that was not lost on her. Lines like &ldquo;But would you bat an eye/Waiting for war machines to pass you by&rdquo; on &ldquo;All Tomorrow&rsquo;s Carry&rdquo; turned into a call to action, a desperate plea to fight the fires of injustice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br/>Even as its lyrics caustically castigate the willfully ignorant, the brutally sparse beats on <em>The Passion Of </em>form forceful techno, daring you to dance amongst shrieks of hopelessly distorted guitar and wails of menacing ambience. This tension between joy and despair threatens to consume until Alli finds a way forward on the final song &ldquo;With Love.&rdquo; The track takes one more sweeping glance at America&rsquo;s disturbing reality of oppression, and then delivers a decree of promised retribution based upon love and unity. Special Interest isn&rsquo;t afraid to face oncoming darkness, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from dancing.</p>`,

He&rsquo;s been to the stars, but for his latest two singles he brings it back down to Earth, digging up the roots of techno. &ldquo;Back2Black&rdquo; ripples with a minimal melody that periodically plunges into the depths of aquamarine textures. &ldquo;TooShay&rdquo; sends a plethora of polyrhythms on parallel paths that insistently stay their course for the large part of the song&rsquo;s 15 minute duration. As the track reaches a climax they collide in a prismatic fashion and scatter like sun rays at a day&rsquo;s end, emitting one last burst of radiance before fading away.</p>`,

        <p>Considering the haunted atmosphere of <em>Battle Royale on Paper</em>, perhaps it&rsquo;s appropriate that I had to re-do my interview with Ari Finkel due to technical difficulties. With a name inspired by scam calls, Finkel&rsquo;s project Fake Phone Number explores an uncanny valley populated by creeping samples climbing darkly textured mountains of techno. Skits aren&rsquo;t relegated to the peripheries, they&rsquo;re incorporated into the tracks, building an interaction that isn&rsquo;t present on most plunder-prone releases. There are moments of morbidity, such as on &ldquo;Stiffs,&rdquo; when, seconds after a sample snatched from the 1987 film <em>Angel Heart </em>describes stiffs going by in a hearse, an unsettling sample sings &ldquo;Homicide, Homicide, Homicide,&rdquo; fading in and out to mimic the doppler effect of a car passing by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the moments of humor are overshadowed by a sense of dread. &ldquo;Nightshade Pt. 1&rdquo; begins innocently enough, sampling a scene from <em>That 70&rsquo;s Show </em>parodying an anti-drug PSA: &ldquo;I have something that&rsquo;s even keener than soda pop. It&rsquo;s called marijuana,&rdquo; spouts a top-hatted man, beckoning a fresh-faced boy to join him. But as the bit takes a dark turn&mdash;&ldquo;All it takes is one puff to make you hopelessly addicted&rdquo;&mdash;a chilling synth slips through the cracks and makes the canned laughs sound frighteningly maniacal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><em>Battle Royale on Paper </em>was inspired by a night Finkel took too many tabs of acid, spiraling him into a terrifying trip that stretched towards infinity. An attempt to calm himself through ambient and jazz tracks just ramped up his anxiety, and he only pulled himself out of it after watching music videos of the menacing but amusing post-punk group The Birthday Party, who in his own words resembled &ldquo;vampires in cowboy outfits.&rdquo; His experience transforming fear into laughter colors the record, and explains why the aptly titled &ldquo;Halloween All Year&rdquo; concludes the album with a clear-eyed groove.</p>`,

MAB&rsquo;s inseparable nature has been an integral element to their creative process since the beginning&mdash;RA started the group after writing songs he wanted someone else to sing&mdash;but on their fourth album they take that mindset to the next level. The entirety of <em>The Cycle </em>was recorded live, with no overdubs and surprisingly few takes. Its sonics are a synthesis of diverse contributions from MAB&rsquo;s eight members: soulful vocals form flesh over skeletal samples, while drums clothe and bursts of horns adorn. Its lyrics speak of love in the midst of struggle, a fitting topic for a band so committed to togetherness.</p>`,

        <p>Nnamd&iuml; Ogbonnaya writes all the lyrics, produces all of the tracks, and plays almost all of the instruments on his fourth album, although you wouldn&rsquo;t guess it by the way he carries himself. Disposed to a casual, humble air, at one point during the interview he shrugs and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that good at drums.&rdquo; None of this timidness can be found on the twelve tracks of <em>BRAT</em>, however. NNAMD&Iuml; is too busy switching styles ranging from hip-hop to math-rock, while simultaneously mixing humor with somberness. On &ldquo;Gimmie Gimmie,&rdquo; he unloads his greedy urges over a gleeful beat, complimented by a music video featuring NNAMD&Iuml; stealing a kid&rsquo;s ice cream cone. &ldquo;Everyone I Loved&rdquo; reckons with strained relationships and the fear of drifting away as NNAMD&Iuml; actively disproves his assertion that he&rsquo;s bad at drums.</p>
        <p><br />After the release of <em>BRAT</em>, it only took three months for another album to emerge. Inspired by looney toons, <em>KRAZY KARL </em>is a whirlwind of rhythmic experimentation and untethered melodies that was whipped up in a week&rsquo;s time. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, NNAMD&Iuml; also drums in the post/math-rock group Monobody, who just released a new single last month. Needless to say you&rsquo;d be lucky to be a NNAMD&Iuml; fan, because there&rsquo;s clearly much more to come.</p>`,

        <p>When I started the Zoom for ONO&rsquo;s interview, I was greeted by their vocalist travis, who was sporting a grizzled grey beard and a wide smile. A wig most closely resembling a jellyfish was wrapped in lights and perched atop his head, while dozens of bedazzled crosses covered the wall behind him, many featuring miniature figurines of a crucified Jesus. I recognized the wig from a fiery performance ONO gave in Chicago, in which travis changes from a raincoat with a frightening hood to an outfit resembling a hazmat suit to an apron-like dress where the wig made its appearance. To my slight disappointment, travis removed it as we prepared to begin the interview.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once travis was joined by his band members Michael P ONO and Jordan Reyes, I asked my first question. What followed was an earnest discussion where I was merely an observer, an attendant of a lecture from a circle of academics and philosophers. I learned about the group&rsquo;s view of capitalism&rsquo;s effect on racial injustice, travis&rsquo; eventful life accented by time spent with the U.S. Navy and his education at Northwestern (from which he graduated with a 4.0 GPA), and the aim of ONO&rsquo;s art to serve as educational activism. <em>Red Summer </em>indeed opens a tome of dark history. travis&rsquo; spoken word vocals reference the Tuskegee incident, The Haitian Revolution, and of course the Red Summer of 1919, weaving together a disturbing web of inequity. The accompanying music is&mdash;according to ONO&rsquo;s mission statement&mdash;not music but rather &ldquo;Experimental, Noise, and Industrial Poetry ... Exploring Gospel's Darkest Conflicts, Tragedies and Premises.&rdquo; More than 40 years after their formation, they&rsquo;re still exploring, and I doubt they&rsquo;ll stop anytime soon.</p>`,
