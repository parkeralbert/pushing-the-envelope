        title: 'Lament',
        artist: 'Touche Amore',
        content: `<b>Best album to listen to when everything is falling apart.</b>
        <p>In a year where anxiety repeatedly got the best of me, <em>Lament </em>was my safe haven. From rage-fueled workouts to panic-ridden drives down the interstate, <em>Lament </em>channeled my chaotic thoughts through eleven songs of blistering post-hardcore. Fittingly, singer Jeremy Bolm kicks off the album with a desperate cry for help: &ldquo;From peaks of blue/Come Heroine&rdquo;&mdash;a cleverly drawn double entendre about a woman he relies on to survive tough times&mdash;while the band barrels towards a climax that crashes into the title track. Out of &ldquo;Lament&rdquo; crawls a broken melody that stumbles over itself, wandering aimlessly as Bolm describes a cycle of sadness and anxiety that anyone who has battled with their brains can relate to.</p>
        <p>Each song on <em>Lament </em>peers into a corner of Bolm&rsquo;s personal darkness, yet he allows a few glimpses of light as well, giving the album a determined drive that can bring someone back from the brink of collapse. The first two verses of &ldquo;Limelight'' pour out the depths of Bolm&rsquo;s fatigue with the world, while the third verse takes a last stand as Manchester Orchestra member Andy Hull makes a desperate swim upwards against Bolm's dark chants. He lets his voice reach manic heights as he runs out of breath, fighting for a gasp of air. Self-proclaimed as the catchiest song in their catalogue, &ldquo;Reminders'' combines political disenchantment with the need for self-love, ending on an unanswered question that bellows with personal resonance: &ldquo;Is there a way to feel free/Without being someone else.&rdquo; On &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Your Host,&rdquo; Bolm deals with the aftermath of making music that heals others when he hasn&rsquo;t finished healing himself. Yet even as he wrestles with the weight of countless letters from fans unloading their grief, the song simultaneously serves as a beacon for anyone that has carried the burden of another.</p>
        <p>The lyrics would be enough to make this record great, but the band comes together to elevate <em>Lament </em>to the next level. Each song slams into one another with the two-ton force of thunderous production and never-ending crescendos, a collection of revelation packed anthems that rush relentlessly to brutally catchy refrains. The stadium sized &ldquo;Deflector&rdquo; is home to false peaks, showcasing the group&rsquo;s deft grasp of song structure -- an unexpected break teases a finale that satisfyingly arrives and impossibly one-ups the rest of the song. After catching one of the only breaths allowed on the album, &ldquo;A Broadcast&rdquo; perfectly captures clenched-fist earnestness, rousing a wordless chorus that would be cliche if Bolm&rsquo;s ragged vocal cords accented by pedal steel didn&rsquo;t make it magical.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For all the hooks and lessons in <em>Lament</em>, nothing is more powerful than the final track &ldquo;A Forecast.&rdquo; Against the distant keys of a sparse piano, Bolm takes a moment to quietly review his progress in processing his mother&rsquo;s death (&ldquo;Since the last time we&rsquo;ve met/I&rsquo;ve healed more than suffered&rdquo;), and then everything implodes. Ocean-deep bass thunders as sparks of guitar shower down upon a heartfelt confession: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still out in the rain/I could use/A little shelter/Now and then.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Lament </em>reminds me that when I fuck up, the world doesn&rsquo;t end, even when I want it to. It&rsquo;s not about winning a fight against dark feelings, it&rsquo;s about the simple act of fighting.</p>`,

        <p>This is another album on the list that helped me through the rushed transition from college to living at home. Before I moved back into my childhood bedroom, I was whisked away to the Rockies with my family, providing me a moment to fully absorb what was happening. We spent hours trudging through deep snow, taking turns clearing a path through the woods and up the mountain. <em>Every Bad </em>accompanied me on this trek, lending acidic strings and fiery guitars to the tornado of thoughts whipped up by the chaos of covid. To listen to <em>Every Bad </em>is to sail a shaky boat through a turbulent sea of feelings while singer Dana Margolin tries to unwind her tangled brain by fashioning neurotic phrases into anthems. This daring voyage allows Porridge Radio to map out the fury and exuberance of being human, hoping just to stay afloat.</p>`,

        content: `<b>Best album to get you into meditation.</b>
        <p>The most basic premise of meditation is to sit and be present. The breath is often used as a focal point - if one gets distracted by thoughts or outside stimuli, focus can always be turned back towards this life force. Phil Elverium&rsquo;s <em>Microphones in 2020</em> starts with just the breath. For the first 8 minutes of the song&rsquo;s forty-five minute duration, two chords played on a five dollar acoustic guitar glide and cascade, unperturbed and at peace. Once Phil enters, he beginsan exercise in excavation, examining his life at three different ages: 17, 20, and 23. Life's undercurrent carries him through ruminations on the frivolity of band names, the tangibility of flashbulb memories, and the strange career of making art, but the song always returns to the breath. <em>Microphones in 2020 </em>simultaneously explores the slippery paradox of the present and the ceaseless nature of time, expressed succinctly in the final lines: "If there have to be words, they could just be/now only and there's no end."</p>`,

        <p>When Fiona casually released this masterpiece into the ether, Pitchfork immediately awarded the album with a perfect ten, something it hadn&rsquo;t done in a decade. Publications stumbled over each other to heap praise upon the undeniable power of <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em>, while I myself was scouring over every song in an attempt to glean each stroke of genius. It&rsquo;s an impossibly active record that crashes you through the ceiling of Fiona&rsquo;s home turned explosive parade featuring clanging percussion found in schoolyards; it&rsquo;s a rapidfire joyride through the synapses of her brain. After a few months of residing here, I began to feel like I was overstaying my welcome, and had to take a long break from listening to the album. Nevertheless, I come by to visit every now and then, and it&rsquo;s always a pleasure.&nbsp;</p>`,

        content: `<b>Best album to listen to while locking yourself in a sauna and taking too many drugs</b>
        <p>Drew Daniel&rsquo;s latest solo effort effectively captures what it would sound like if Steve Reich had been an avid raver. The opening track features angelic voices hypnotically repeating the record&rsquo;s title amidst chiming bells, imbuing the album with a strangely monastic quality. Fittingly, the two most important moments are found on the tracks &ldquo;Sinning'' and &ldquo;Grace.&rdquo; On the former, piano, clarinet, and saxophone circle one another in minimalist patterns, while booming bass and syncopated handclaps set up a sweaty club atmosphere. On &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; a gentle piano melody meanders through swirling synths, dissipates into a cloud of raucous ambience, and slyly builds into the album&rsquo;s most transcendent moment. The perfect balance of soothing minimalism and adrenaline-pumping dance music, <em>Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? </em>maps out an ideal vision of ecstasy.</p>`,

        <p>Jeff Parker&rsquo;s <em>Suite for Max Brown </em>is cut from the same exploratory cloth as his renowned work with post-rock group Tortoise. Evading sonic expectations, Parker relentlessly tinkers with the jazz template to incorporate spaced-out ambience and trance-like rhythms into a delightful mood board. The methodical mindset of interlocking grooves on "Fusion Swirl" evaporates into atmospheric track &ldquo;After The Rain,&rdquo; which drizzles drowsy guitar over Vangelis-textured keys, perfectly evoking its namesake. After taking its time on a winding path that keeps you guessing, the record rides out on the ten minute closer &ldquo;Max Brown.&rdquo; Perhaps the most traditional track on the album, it&rsquo;s a satisfying send-off that proves Parker can play it straight too.</p>`,

        content: `<b>Most consistently inconsistent album</b>
        <p>Imagine a new thrift store opened up a few blocks from your place. You&rsquo;ve heard from friends it&rsquo;s a bit janky, but you still want to check it out. It&rsquo;s called <em>Notes On a Conditional Form</em>. Upon entering the store, you&rsquo;re immediately greeted by Greta Thurnburg, who delivers a rousing speech about the immediacy of addressing climate change over twinkling piano. <em>That&rsquo;s very inspiring,</em> you think, <em>but what a bizarre introduction. </em>As you shuffle past Greta and make your way down an aisle, you notice something that seems out of place. A cinematic interlude of Disney proportions (&ldquo;The End (Music for Cars)&rdquo;) and a slice of pastiche punk (&ldquo;People&rdquo;) sit side by side, eschewing any organizational logic. You push through more instrumental filler and arrive at a sparkling gem: &ldquo;The Birthday Party.&rdquo; An alt-country ballad ornamented with banjo and pedal-steel, the song exposes the paranoia and disenchantment Matty Healy holds with his own behavior: &ldquo;I depend/On my friends/To stay clean.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The entire album continues in this hit-or-miss fashion, flirting with a jumbled ensemble of pop templates. Some songs make it seem like Matty&rsquo;s trying on styles just for laughs, such as &ldquo;Roadkill,&rdquo; which emulates Pinegrove so closely that I swear the line about a &ldquo;tucked-up erection&rdquo; is throwing shade at them. &ldquo;Me and You Together Song&rdquo;&mdash;a direct injection of jangly dream pop stolen straight from the 90&rsquo;s&mdash;almost looks like the real thing, but is smothered with a sheen of self-aware tackiness. It successfully rides the line between affecting and annoying, but &ldquo;If You&rsquo;re Too Shy (Let Me Know)&rdquo; crosses it. The chugging synths and yearning lyrics of the verses play to the band&rsquo;s strengths, but the chorus hews dangerously close to the melody and mentality of &ldquo;Shut Up and Dance.&rdquo; The fact that I&rsquo;ll still listen to the entire song, even enduring the cheesy saxophone solo, illustrates the overall appeal of <em>Notes</em>. It&rsquo;s sickeningly earnest enough to make you shake your head, but its addictive catchiness will make you smile. This isn't any more apparent than on the satisfying closer &ldquo;Guys," where Matty ditches the dress-up. Stripping down to his pure self, he sings a sweetly unadorned ode to his bandmates: &ldquo;You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo; <em>Notes On a Conditional Form </em>is far from a perfect album, but I guarantee if you take the time to sort through the mess, you&rsquo;ll find something to take home.</p>`,

        <p>On Fountain, Lyra Pramuk is a master shapeshifter. Her voice is stretched, distorted, and multiplied across 7 tracks with vastly different palettes. &ldquo;Tendril&rdquo; is joyous, floating a soaring melody over buoyant hums, while following track &ldquo;Xeno&rdquo; does a 180 as Lyra takes the form of a horde of locusts, swarming around a dark synth that expands until it blocks out the sun. On &ldquo;Cradle&rdquo;, the drone of a cello draws a fog across Lyra&rsquo;s deeply ruminative singing, untils she breaks forth with a wordless rendition of the English hymn &ldquo;O Waly, Waly&rdquo; that transforms the song into a heavenly hymn. &ldquo;Cradle&rdquo; illustrates what each track on Fountain has in common: the ability to transcend, to swirl and layer fragments of the human voice until they become something greater, something beyond the self.</p>`,

        <p>Julianna Barwick&rsquo;s ethereal experiments have always been soothing, but <em>Healing is a Miracle </em>checks Barwick into therapy. After dealing with the aftershock of a divorce and years of grueling tours, she recently moved from New York to Los Angeles and started dating someone new. She&rsquo;s expanded her typically insular method of layering vocal loops by inviting collaborators to share space on the album. Sigur R&oacute;s&rsquo;s J&oacute;nsi contributes a delicate croon on &ldquo;In Light,&rdquo; flickers of Mary Lattimore&rsquo;s harp decorate &ldquo;Oh, Memory,&rdquo; and Nosaj Thing winds pensive harmonies around Barwick&rsquo;s on &ldquo;Nod.&rdquo; Best listened to when you need to catch a breath.</p>`,

        <p>Last summer I became spellbound by Autechre&rsquo;s 1994 landmark album <em>Amber</em>. The record is known for being Autechre&rsquo;s most emotional and melodic work, leading the duo to later dismiss it as &ldquo;cheesy.&rdquo; Yet the album&rsquo;s papery textures and haunting atmosphere quickly won me over, along with the realization that <em>Kid A </em>definitely took influence from songs like &ldquo;Montreal.&rdquo; 26 years after <em>Amber</em>, and Autechre is still on the bleeding edge of electronic experimentation. In some ways, <em>SIGN </em>mimics the approach of <em>Amber</em>: it&rsquo;s less cold-blooded than Autechre&rsquo;s other output, relying instead on capturing fleeting feelings. <em>SIGN </em>functions as a splatter painting, featuring a myriad of metallic synths that leave a mark on the canvas before dissipating. Squint hard enough and you might be able to make out a sketch of a melody, but more than anything else <em>SIGN </em>is about setting the mood.</p>`,

        <p>Eartheater&rsquo;s new album lurks under the surface.

After escaping haunts of metal-infused glitches and computer-mangled voices, the album finds its haven in the centerpiece &ldquo;Volcano.&rdquo; A classically-bent piano pirouettes while a dejected angel laments (&ldquo;I'm still grinding bones to bake my bread/Grinding on a skull to get ahead&rdquo;). The song presents constant sorrow as a comfort, something to count on. As the album&rsquo;s title suggests, <em>Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin </em>shapes pain into something that glistens.

I waited till everyone had fallen asleep and walked down to our dock that overlooked the water, sitting there and listening to <em>Punisher </em>front to back while watching the river&rsquo;s reflection of the moon.
